Our brain is constantly in "energy saving mode": it is lazy and always looking for shortcuts to save energy; that's why, when it comes to inquire about something, people have a tendency to rely on a single source, often the first one they come into contact with, and take everything it says as unique and absolute truth. 
Whereas in the past the main source was newspapers, today the main source of information are definitely **Social Networks**. 

The advent of technology has meant that, nowadays, disinformation is almost impossible because, somehow, we always come into contact with some form of news: maybe a repost on Facebook from a friend of ours, a post on LinkedIn from a colleague of ours, a tweet on Twitter from a person we esteem, a story on Instagram, a video on TikTok and so on; from the problem of *disinformation*, we have moved on to the problem of *misinformation* and *manipulated information*.
But why someone should bother themselves to "manipulate the information"? Well, Information is power, and "guiding" the thought of the masses towards a specific idea, is convenient especially when someone is fighting a battle to gain more power; and today it has become easier than ever, thanks to this very interconnection that everyone has through Social Networks, to guide the thoughts of the masses on to beliving something. 
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal" target="_blank">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal has shown us how all the data that we "give away" online to the **Tech-Giants**, allowed them to manipulate people's thoughts to get them to vote for a certain candidate compared to another, or how easy it is to trigger panic when a virus, like the coronavirus, begins to cast its shadow on mankind.

Of course, after these terrible events and after the pressure of governments, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51337357" target="_blank">the companies behind the major social networks have started to take steps to mitigate the spread of these **Fake News**</a> by putting in place techniques such as censorship, warnings and redirecting to an authoritative sources to inform their users in the right way, in order to fight against the spreading of these Fake News.

But is that enough?

In my opinion, it is not.
No, because what these giants do is nothing more than invade our privacy even more, reading every post or limiting the spread of any kind of information on a large scale, as reported in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51337357" target="_blank">previous article</a>: *"Facebook-owned messaging site WhatsApp [...] announced measures to prevent users from forwarding messages to more than five people or groups. It also adds a tag to heavily forwarded messages "*. This seems to me to be a huge violation of personal privacy and it makes me realize that Facebook is able to control certain processes carried out by its users within its messaging app.

The platforms we use every day are private platforms, owned and operated by private companies whose purpose is not so much to be ethical or to spread verified news, but to make profits, and this puts them in a position where it is easier to forgive than to ask permission. But I'm digressing.

The solutions to the Fake News problem, in my opinion, are:

1. **DYOR** (Do Your Own Research): educate the people not to trust a single source but to research, understand, ask questions and make their own ideas based on many sources.

2. **Relying on websites where the news are verified**: since, as previously mentioned, our brain is lazy and it is more difficult to do some research than is to read a single article (or a title, in some cases), we should get informed on sites where the news are checked, approved and modified by many people. Websites like: <a href="https://wikinews.org" target="_blank"> WikiNews </a> or <a href="https://wt.social" target="_blank"> WikiTribunal </a> or even websites like <a href="https://reddit.com" target="_blank"> reddit </a> where the news are crowdsourced there are community checks and comments.

3. **AI**: we have already talked about Artificial Intelligence, so another option could be to train a neural network that takes multiple sources and put them together into a neutral and bias-free articles with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

Personally I'm very attracted to projects like WikiTribunal and, for this reason, I hope that this project can really be adopted by the masses.
As we have Instagram for photos, YouTube for videos, Wikipedia for the online encyclopedia and Facebook to remind us our mom's birthday, I hope that one day, WikiTribunal, could become the place where everyone will go to read the news.
